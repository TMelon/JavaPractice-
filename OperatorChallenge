    Step 1 is to create a double variable with a value of 20.00.
    Step 2 create a second variable of type double with a value 80.00.
    Step 3 is to add both numbers together then multiply by 100.00.
    Step 4 use the remainder operator to figure out what the remainder
    from the result of the operation in step three and 40.00 is.
    Now we have used the modulus or remainder operator on ints in this course
    but I'm confirming here you can also do the same for double
    a variable of type double.
    Step 5 create a boolean variable that assigns the value true
    if the remainder in step 4 is 0.00 or false if it's not zero.
    Step 6 output the boolean variable just to see what the result is
    Step 7 write an if-then statement that displays a message 'got some remainder'
    if the boolean in step five is not true.
